# Projects-TuringAcademy
Repository with both projects proposed during Turing Academy, onboarding program of Turing USP.
- The focus of the first one is cleaning and analysing data, as well as making a Machine Learning model to predict if an employee deserves a promotion based on their
  features, such as age and number of years at the company. The datasets used for this project are in train.csv and test.csv files. 
- The second one is about Neural Networks and the objective is to create a NN that predicts if an asteroid is prejudicial or not to the Earth,
  based on it's phisics features. The dataset used for this project is neo.csv.
